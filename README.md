This script implements the Simultaneous Graphical DLM (SGDLM) of West & Harrison (1997) and Gruber & West (2016), extended so each DLM model stacks its own $p$ lags **and** the $p\$ cross-lags of all other series. This notebook walks through every step, from data prep to reconstructing the final dynamic VAR coefficients, using a decouple‚Äìrecouple Variational Bayes + importance-sampling algorithm.

## Notebook Outline

1. **Data & Configuration**  
   - Load your multivariate time series $Y$ and specify the contemporaneous graph mask.  
   - Set lag order $p$, pandemic dummy horizon, Minnesota‚Äêprior hyperparameters, and Monte Carlo draws $R$.

2. **Design & Prior Setup**  
   - Construct lagged and dummy‚Äêaugmented regressor matrices for each series.  
   - Compute AR(1) empirical moments and assemble Minnesota‚Äêstyle priors for all coefficient blocks.

3. **Recoupling & VB-IS Refinement**  
   - Fuse marginal DLM outputs via sparse Monte Carlo draws under the graph mask.  
   - Compute VB moment updates (covariance, Mahalanobis traces, degrees of freedom, scales) using importance weights.  
   - Iterate coordinate VB and importance‚Äêsampling corrections as needed.

4. **Decoupling: Parallel DLM Updates**  
   - Run independent univariate DLM filters for each series‚Äîincorporating own‚Äê and cross‚Äêlags plus exogenous dummies.  
   - Obtain one‚Äêstep forecast gains, updated state means/covariances, and sample noise precisions.

5. **Results & Diagnostics**  
   - Reconstruct time‚Äêvarying VAR coefficient matrices and error covariance.  
   - Plot trace/histograms of precision chains, forecast densities.  
   - Unconditional k-step out-of-sample forecasts.

## How to Use

### Option 1 ‚Äî Notebook (all-in-one)  
1. Open **`bayesian_sgdlm.ipynb`** in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.  
2. Run all cells in order to reproduce the **full pipeline end-to-end**.  
   - This includes priors, dummies, matrices, decoupling/recoupling, MCMC, and forecasting.  
3. Modify the **Parameters** cell (lags, dummies, Œª, œÜ, Œ≥, $R$, priors...) to experiment.  

üëâ This notebook is ideal for people who like to see the entire workflow executed in a single run, without having to navigate between modules.

### Option 2 ‚Äî Modular Code (from `src/`)  
For users who prefer **modular code organization**, the implementation is structured under the `src/` folder:  

src/
‚îú‚îÄ decouple_recouple.py # decoupling/recoupling steps, n_solve, s_sol
‚îú‚îÄ dummies.py # covid_dummy and related
‚îú‚îÄ forecast.py # forecasting routines (u_forecast, osf, us)
‚îú‚îÄ matrices.py # Fj_matrix, Wjmatrix, A_matrix, etc.
‚îú‚îÄ mcmc.py # mcmc_forward
‚îú‚îÄ priors.py # prior_AM_pp, full_size, complete_AP
‚îú‚îÄ proxies.py # proxy updates (proxy_lambdj, proxy_theta_j2, etc.)

Each file contains the corresponding building blocks, so you can import only the parts you need: 

```python
from src.matrices import Fj_matrix
from src.forecast import u_forecast
```
